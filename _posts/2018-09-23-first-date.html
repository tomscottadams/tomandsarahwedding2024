<p>A lesser known fact about Tom and I is that we’d actually met before we actually met. 
    We both went to King Edward VI College, but a series of unfortunate events kept us from meeting properly.

                Becky and Tom went to Doctor Who club together, I chose creative writing instead.<br> 
                    Tom was good friends with one of my friends, Jon Lench. Sadly he never introduced us.<br>
                    Tom also managed to capture me in the background of a video of him and his friends dancing in Chicago’s… 
                    if only we’d turned around.

        Tom took this video on 2nd April 2014, over 4 years before we properly met!<br></span>

<p>It seems fate was trying to keep us apart, but that couldn’t last forever.</p>

<p>So where did it all begin?</p>

<p>Well it all started with a character reference, and a very long breakfast…</p>

<p>In the late summer of 2018, I finally met Tom properly.<br>
    After some early conversations, I decided a character reference was in order so I asked the only mutual friend we had.</p>

<p><blockquote class="blockquote">“Do you know a Tom Scott-Adams?” </blockquote> 
I asked Lenchy.</p>

<p><blockquote class="blockquote">“Oh God, what has he done now?”</blockquote>
    Was his encouraging response.</p>

<p>Of course, Lenchy gave him a brilliant reference and a date was arranged in the two-day window between Tom getting home from holiday and his leaving for Manchester to start his Master’s degree.</p>

<p>Starting with a breakfast of pancakes and bacon from the Cock ’n Bull on a Sunday morning, one hour turned into two, and we didn’t want the date to end. We then decided to drive to Kinver to visit an antiques fair, but we were so caught up in conversation, we missed the turning and instead somehow ended up in Bridgnorth. We went up to the Cliff railway, had some coffee and joked about Tom’s poor sense of direction.</p>

<p>On the way home, we stopped at a pub and realised we’d spent the whole day together!</p>

<p>The spark was lit.</p>
