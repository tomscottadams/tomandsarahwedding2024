<p>Choosing my wedding dress was a bit daunting as there are so many options; Ballgown, A-line, Mermaid, Trumpet, Silk, Lace, Satin, tulle, chiffon… all words that mean nothing to Tom. Only joking, he loves Say yes to the dress.</p>

<p>Becky recommended the first place to try on wedding dresses as The Dressing Rooms, Halesowen as she had a great experience choosing hers from there (this post is not sponsored btw).</p>

<p>I had a rather large entourage to provide support, Becky, my Mom, my Nana, and Tom’s Mom and his Aunties.</p>

<p>I had no idea what style I wanted, there was too much choice, so I wanted to try on EVERYTHING.</p>

<p>The first dress I tried on was a huge ballgown with a VERY deep v neck and transparent side panels that becky chose because she wanted a laugh. I wanted to try it because it looked horrendous. I looked like a trampy muffin. This was immediately met with a definitive no from everyone, especially my Nana. She always knows best.</p>

<p>The second dress I tried on was much more modest, but boring. Not me at all. Becky said it gave ’50 year old woman / third marriage’ vibes. So we put that back on the rack.</p>

<p>The third dress was a different story altogether, I can’t remember who picked it out, but I tried it on and it was perfection. It felt like it was made just for me. I can’t say anymore as Tom is compiling this post! But I will say that I said there and then to myself in the mirror that it was “The Dress”.</p>

<p>Fine I will tell you about my wedding dress… it’s white.</p>

<p>The dress consultant suggested I try on a few more with different things that I like about this one, to really make sure I wasn’t leaving anything behind, however, after trying on another four dresses, I was still in love with dress number three.</p>

<p>I tried on my dress again and got out the accessories, I tried on a tiara (which was a no.) and several veils. I felt beautiful. I knew I could walk down the aisle in a bin bag and Tom would still marry me, but it helps to do it in a lovely dress.</p>

<p>Most successful shopping trip ever!</p>
